# Loan Management System – Take-Home Test

This repository contains the implementation of a **Loan Management System**, developed woth .NET.  
The solution includes a **.NET Web API backend** and a **simplified Angular frontend**, with a focus on clean architecture, testability, and maintainability.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The backend follows a **Clean Architecture** approach, with clear separation of concerns:

```
/src
 ├── Fundo.Applications.Domain         // Domain entities and business rules
 ├── Fundo.Applications.Application    // CQRS, MediatR, validators, DTOs
 ├── Fundo.Applications.Infrastructure // EF Core, repositories (Repository pattern and Unit of work), persistence
 └── Fundo.Applications.WebApi         // API layer (controllers, middleware)
```

Key architectural decisions:
- CQRS with **MediatR**
- **Entity Framework Core** for persistence
- **FluentValidation** for request validation
- **AutoMapper** for entity-to-DTO mapping
- Global exception handling middleware
- Unit and integration testing with **xUnit**

---

## 🚀 Running the Project

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK **8.0+**
- Node.js **20.x (LTS)**
- Docker & Docker Compose**
---

### ▶️ Run Backend (Local)

```bash
cd src/Fundo.Applications.WebApi
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at:

```
https://localhost:5001
```

> In **Development** environment, EF Core migrations are applied automatically and seed data is generated.

---

### ▶️ Run Backend with Docker

From the repository root:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:
- The Web API
- SQL Server (containerized)

---

### ▶️ Run Frontend (Angular)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at:

```
http://localhost:4200
```

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

Testing strategy:
- Unit tests for application layer handlers and domain logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints using `WebApplicationFactory`
- Integration tests use **EF Core InMemory** to avoid external dependencies

---

## 🔐 Validation & Error Handling

- Input validation via **FluentValidation**
- Consistent error responses through a global exception middleware
- Clear separation between validation errors, domain errors, and unexpected failures
- Explicit CORS configuration

---

## 📋 Implemented Features

### Backend
- Create loan
- Retrieve loan by ID
- List all loans
- Apply payments
- Seed data for development
- Dockerized backend
- Structured logging
- Unit and integration tests

### Frontend
- Display list of loans
- Basic interaction with backend API

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Aligning framework versions across projects

---

## 🚧 Features Not Fully Implemented

Due to time constraints:
- Authentication and authorization
- Advanced frontend UX and validations
- Swagger / OpenAPI documentation

---

## 🔮 Possible Improvements

With additional time:
- Replace EF Core InMemory with SQLite InMemory for more realistic integration tests
- Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Improve frontend UX and error handling
- Add pagination and filtering to loan listing

## 📬 Final Notes

This project aims to demonstrate solid backend engineering practices, clean architecture principles, and pragmatic testing strategies suitable for real-world applications.
